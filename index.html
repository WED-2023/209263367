  <h2>Q&A ‚Äì Web1 vs Web2 vs Web3</h2>

  <details class="qa-item">
    <summary><strong>1. List three main differences between Web1, Web2, and Web3</strong></summary>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Web1 (The Static Web):</strong> Read-only content with minimal interactivity. Websites were static and informational. Users could not contribute or interact.</li>
      <li><strong>Web2 (The Social Web):</strong> Read-write web with user-generated content. Users could share, comment, create content, and interact.</li>
      <li><strong>Web3 (The Semantic Web):</strong> Intelligent and decentralized web using AI and blockchain. Emphasizes personalization, smart assistants, data ownership, and automation.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details class="qa-item">
    <summary><strong>2. Explain the differences using a use case</strong></summary>
    <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Searching for ‚Äúside effects of medications‚Äù</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Web1:</strong> The user finds a basic static website listing side effects. No comments, updates, or interactivity. The content is curated and unchanging.</li>
      <li><strong>Web2:</strong> The user searches on Google, reads blogs or forum posts, watches videos on YouTube, and sees user reviews or shared experiences. It‚Äôs interactive and social.</li>
      <li><strong>Web3:</strong> The user uses a decentralized medical knowledge platform. AI understands the search intent, provides personalized and verified results, possibly rewards the user for contributing data, and ensures privacy via blockchain.</li>
